		<p>The Internet and social media were never free. The hidden price for interconnectivity has always been your personal data. All of your actions are being tracked, stored and sold.</p>

		<p>Companies of all sizes spend billions of dollars annually on personal <a href="http://blog.meeco.me/charlotte-and-the-digital-birth-of-her-baby-boy/" target="blank">information about you</a>. This can range from your browsing behavior to your health conditions. This data is used to <a href="http://blog.meeco.me/the-day-i-realised-my-personal-data-was-no-longer-mine/" target="blank">advertise to you</a>, grant or deny you insurance and decide whether or not you’ll get your next job.</p> 

		<p>We do not accept the premise that your information should be traded without your consent. It’s both in your and brands’ interest to meet halfway and partake in a mutually beneficial transaction.</p>

		<P>The way the system is broken is that you—as a citizen—are constantly targeted with advertising that’s not pertinent to your life and companies waste money to reach an audience who’s not in buying mode.</P>

		<p>This data visualization is a project by three Hyper Island Digital Data Strategy students, in collaboration with personal data platform <a href="https://meeco.me/" target="blank">Meeco</a>.</p> 

		<p>Your data changes with time and depending on developments in your life. We selected a few interesting data points in our visualization. These are already being sold on the <a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/everything-we-know-about-what-data-brokers-know-about-you" target="blank">data brokering marketplace</a>—that’s where companies buy your personal data unbeknownst to you.</p> 

		<p>We collected Avg. CPL (Cost Per Lead) for specific industries. That is, how much it cost for a company to organically advertise to you and gain you as a customer. Finally, we researched how many companies are active in each specific industry.</p> 

		<p>The hypothesis is that, on a platform where brands can directly ask citizens for permission to access their data, its value could (initially) be worth the company’s CPL—to advertise to you otherwise—compounded by the number of requests you receive.</p>

		<p><b>DV (Data Value) = BCPL (Brand Cost Per Lead) X Requests</b></p>

		<p>As an example, if you’re in the market for buying new shoes and you express your interest for shoemaking brands to access your data, you could sell a package of your browsing information for a specific month—i.e what online stores you visited, how old you are, your email, what models you liked on Pinterest, etc.— to all the brands that request it. The brands in return, would pay this symbolical CPL “fee” to you once, avoiding to waste millions of marketing dollars used otherwise to entice a public who is not interested in their products.</p>

		<p>We like to call this <b>“Permission Economy”</b>.</p>

		<p>This opens philosophical, ethical and financial questions that none of us can predict yet.</p>

		<p>We decided to partner with Meeco because they believe that <b>“Data Is The New Currency”</b> and its most valuable when it’s <b>“Accurate + In Context + Up-To-Date + United With Your Intent”</b>.</p>

		<p>Meeco is a service that let’s you unite your preferences and intentions—when and if you want to—with the growing demand of businesses to facilitate an open exchange that is transparent and respectful to both parties.</p>

		<p>We believe that the right to privacy is one of the most important civil rights issues of our time.</p>
